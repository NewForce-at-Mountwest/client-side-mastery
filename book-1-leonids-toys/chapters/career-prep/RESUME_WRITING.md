# 6. Getting Started on Your Resume

## Tech Resume Overview

We're going to start out by getting started on your tech resume! Tech resumes include all of the same things as an average resume, plus a little extra. The focus of a tech resume is to highlight the software development skills you’ve gained through your technical experience. It’s also important to highlight previous work because most of your past experiences will be transferable to a tech career! 

You will begin building your technical resume on your own, in a Google Doc. Trust us, you’ll want it here first so you can copy and paste it to various other places later, like LinkedIn. Don't worry about formatting at this point-- we'll make it look pretty later. You also don't need to worry about making anything sound fancy or including any special resume buzzwords. This is just a rough draft! Your only goal is to get words on a page. Once you have a draft, we'll go over it together.

## Getting Started
1. Open this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkqzZkWCd14V9QPlFQf9ynrXDA8fnvLJiYP4pC8AWNA/edit?usp=sharing) but DON'T EDIT IT!
1. In the top menu, go to "File" > "Make a Copy"
1. Click on the title of the doc to rename it. Name it "Your Name -- Resume Text"
1. Bookmark your resume text doc! You'll need to refer to it many times throughout the next six months. 

Once you've created your doc, you're ready to go on to building your personal profile!
