# 9. Vocabulary Review

Knowing how to talk about what you've learned is hard, especially at this stage! It's okay if the vocabulary still feels fuzzy. 

Over the course of the next six months, we'll practice using technical jargon to talk about code. Technical jargon gets a bad rap, but it's actually useful-- it gives developers shared language to talk about complicated things pretty quickly, and have clear conversations where everyone's on the same page. It's also going to be important when we do interview prep. 

Let's start by reviewing some of the terms you saw in this book. You don't need to memorize these. Just spend 10-20 minutes reviewing them before you move onto the next book.
