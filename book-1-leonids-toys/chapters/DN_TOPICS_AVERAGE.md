# 6. Average Topics per Note

## Instructions

Add a new section of output where you can see, on average, how many topics the author are applying to each post.

Start with `console.log("*** Average Topics Per Note ***")` and display the average numbers of topics used on all posts.


### Run Your Code

In your terminal, run your code with the following command.

```sh
node main.js
```

When you run the code, it should display something like the following.

```txt
*** Average Topics Per Note ***
2.0
```

## Hint

Remember, use all the other resources at your disposal before looking at hints. Start thinking like a professional now and become an efficient learner, not a lazy one.

```js
// Need to count up all the topics, so start at 0
const totalTopics = 0

// Iterate all of the notes
for (const note of notes) {
    /*
        Increase the value of `totalTopics` by the number
        of topics on this note
    */
    totalTopics = totalTopics +
}

// Calculate the overall average


// Output the average to the terminal
```
