# 6. Practice: Calculating Average

## Instructions

In this exercise, you will be doing what you did in the last one, but you will need to write more code yourself. You can even open up the last exercise in another browser window so that you can easily look at that code, and write code here.

## Setup

```sh
cd
cd workspace
mkdir traveling-salesperson
cd traveling-salesperson
touch main.js
code .
```

## Starter Code

```js
// You fill in some sample weekly miles traveled in this array
const weeklyMiles = [  ]

// Declare a variable to store the total. Initial value is 0.

/*
	Iterate the array of miles with a for..of loop.
	Add each mileage to the total mileage variable.
*/
for () {

}

// Declare a new variable to store the average miles over time

// Output the average miles and the total miles to the console
console.log()
```

## Run Your Code

In your terminal, run your code with the following command.

```sh
node main.js
```

When you run the code, it should display the following, but with actual numbers instead of the `xxx`.

```sh
I average xxx miles each week.
I have driven a total of xxx miles.
```
